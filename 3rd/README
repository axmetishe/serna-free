PRECONDITIONS:

Before building 3rd make sure that you also checked out one of the 
following modules on the top level (i.e. where 3rd is checked out):

buildsys        
st_common       
serna
xslgen          
dtd2xs         
all

BUILDING 3rd:

On unix:

Using gcc 2.96 (Redhat Version for Linux)
Using gcc 2.95.3 (FreeBSD)

1. ./configure [(static|dynamic)] [(debug|release)]
2. make -f TMakefile.gnu install (on FreeBsd use gmake)

On Windows:

PRECONDITIONS:

Make sure you set the following variables:

MSDevDir C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98
PATH C:\Program Files\Intel\edb;C:\Program Files\Intel\iselect\bin6;C:\Program Files\Intel\compiler50\ia32\bin;d:\program files\vslick\win;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Tools\WinNT;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Tools;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\bin
LIB C:\Program Files\Intel\compiler50\ia32\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\mfc\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\lib
INCLUDE C:\Program Files\Intel\compiler50\ia32\include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\atl\include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\mfc\include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\include

NOTE: These variables are coming from MS Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32.bat

Using Visual C++ 6.0 SP 5 (Some apps code is built with Intel C++ 5.0)

1. configure.bat [(static|dynamic)] [(debug|release)]
2. checked_build.bat 

Note: after installing an intel compiler on win32 the following files
was removed from PATH:

    C:\Program Files\Intel\iselect\Bin6\cl.exe
    C:\Program Files\Intel\iselect\Bin6\link.exe

It was simply renamed to ~cl.exe and ~link.exe.

LOG FILES:

Currently the build process is logged into the following files:

qt/3.0.0/qt-x11-commercial-US-3.0.0/configure.log

BUILDING SUBCOMPONENTS:

Buildsystem is supposed to build all the components in a 
module, but if it fails so, you may try to build a component
with

make -f TMakefile.gnu install

in its subdirectory

BUILDING APPLICATIONS:

Checkout the correspondingmodule (say xslgen on toplevel), and then go to src/apps/xslgene to 
see README for furhter instructions.
