Serna Free XML editor is an easy-to-use open source WYSIWYG XML editor for those who wish to smoothly adopt the XML technology. Indeed, Serna Free is the most powerful among free and open source XML editors for WYSIWYG authoring. 
Most people will find Serna Free XML content editor easy to use as it hides all the complexities of the underlying XML technology. Authors with virtually no XML experience can easily start working with structured XML content in a familiar environment that looks much like a conventional word processor.

In our master project MBSA we use docbook documentation, so we need human-friendly xml editor so we try to reincarnate this project AS IS and provide some packaging.
